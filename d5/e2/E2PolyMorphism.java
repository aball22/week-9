        // A non-abstract method displayArea() that prints "The area of the shape is: [area]"
        // Create a class Circle that extend Shape:
        // Has a private instance variable radius (double).Implement the calculateArea() method to return the area of the circle (Ï€ * r^2)
        // Create a class Rectangle that extend Shape:
        // Has private instance variables width and height (both double).Implement the calculateArea() method to return the area of the rectangle (width * height)
        // Add constructors to Circle and Rectangle classes to initialize their respective instance variables.
        // Step 3: In the E2PolyMorphism  class,Main class,Create an array of Shape objects containing at least one Circle and one Rectangle.
        // Iterate through the array and call the displayArea() method for each shape.Print the output to verify that all methods are being called correctly
